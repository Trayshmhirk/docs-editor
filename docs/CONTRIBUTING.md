# Contributing to docs-editor

Thank you for contributing. This guide covers setup, workflow, commit conventions, and pull requests.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Trayshmhirk/docs-editor.git
cd docs-editor
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in values (when .env.example exists)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Branch strategy

```txt
master  ← production-ready releases
  └── dev  ← integration branch for development work
        └── feature/*  ← individual tasks
```

1. Branch from `dev` for new work.
2. Open pull requests into `dev`.
3. Merge `dev` → `master` when a phase or milestone is stable.

## Scripts

| Command             | Description                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Start development server   |
| `npm run build`     | Production build           |
| `npm run lint`      | Run ESLint                 |
| `npm run format`    | Format with Prettier (TBD) |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check (TBD)     |

Scripts marked TBD will be added in [Phase 0](./plans/phase-0-tooling.md).

## Commit conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Format

```txt
<type>[optional scope]: <subject>

[optional body]
```

### Types

| Type       | When to use                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature                         |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                             |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                  |
| `style`    | Formatting, no logic change         |
| `refactor` | Code change that is not feat or fix |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests            |
| `chore`    | Tooling, deps, config               |
| `ci`       | CI/CD changes                       |
| `build`    | Build system changes                |

### Rules

1. **Every line must be under 100 characters** (subject, body, and bullets).
2. **Describe what changed functionally**, not how it was implemented.
3. Use **imperative mood** in the subject: "add feature" not "added feature".
4. Use **flat bullet points** in the body for multi-part changes — no nested bullets.

### Do not include in commit messages

- JSX/HTML tags (`<div>`, `<form>`)
- CSS or Tailwind class names (`bg-blue-500`, `flex-col`)
- Variable names, hook names, or function names (`useState`, `handleSubmit`)
- File paths with line numbers as the primary description

### Examples

**Good subject lines:**

```txt
feat(share): add email validation before document invite
fix(collaboration): correct event listener cleanup on title edit
docs: add development roadmap for phases 0-4
chore: add husky and lint-staged
ci: add github actions workflow for lint and build
```

**Bad subject lines:**

```txt
feat(share): add regex in ShareModal onClick handler
fix: update CollaborativeRoom.tsx useEffect cleanup function
style: change bg-[#00afdb] to bg-[#0081a4] on share button
```

**Good body:**

```txt
feat(editor): enable table plugin

- Allow inserting tables from the toolbar
- Sync table edits across collaborators via Liveblocks
- Style table borders in light and dark themes
```

**Bad body:**

```txt
feat(editor): enable table plugin

- Added TablePlugin to Editor.tsx
- Imported TableNode from @lexical/table
- Added btn with className="table-insert" to ToolbarPlugin
```

### Multiline commit command

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(scope): short subject under 100 chars

- First functional change described plainly
- Second functional change described plainly
EOF
)"
```

### Enforcement

Once Phase 0 is complete:

- **Husky** runs lint-staged on pre-commit (Prettier + ESLint).
- **commitlint** validates commit message format on commit-msg hook.

## Pull request conventions

### Title

Use conventional commit format, reflecting the primary change:

```txt
feat(collaboration): add live cursors and presence
```

### Description structure

```markdown
## Summary

One short paragraph describing the overall change and why.

## Key Changes

- First flat bullet
- Second flat bullet
- Third flat bullet

## Test plan

- [ ] Step to verify change one
- [ ] Step to verify change two
```

### PR rules

1. **Summary** — high-level purpose only, one paragraph.
2. **Key Changes** — flat list, no nested or indented sub-bullets.
3. Base the description on **actual commit messages** in the branch.
4. Include a **Test plan** when the change affects runtime behavior.

### Creating a PR

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD

gh pr create --base dev --title "feat(scope): short title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

...

## Key Changes

- ...
- ...

## Test plan

- [ ] ...
EOF
)"
```

GitHub will also pre-fill the description from [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](../.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Git hooks (Phase 0)

After Phase 0 tooling is installed:

| Hook         | Action                                    |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | lint-staged (Prettier + ESLint on staged) |
| `commit-msg` | commitlint (conventional format + length) |

Do not skip hooks with `--no-verify` unless there is a documented reason.

## Planning docs

Development roadmap plans live in [`docs/plans/`](./plans/README.md). Check the relevant phase before starting work.

## AI agents

Agents working in this repo must follow:

- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)
- [`.cursor/rules/git-and-pr-conventions.mdc`](../.cursor/rules/git-and-pr-conventions.mdc)

Agents may commit when the user asks. Present the commit message for approval first, then run `git commit`. Do not push unless the user explicitly requests it. Never add `Co-authored-by` or other commit trailers.
